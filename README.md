# Barcode-and-Qrcode

Barcodes and QR codes are very cool and interesting because they store information in a different format. The fun part about them is that we canâ€™t tell what they are storing until we analyze them. <br />

# Getting Started

The first step is to install the following three libraries: Pillow, OpenCV and Pyzbar. Pillow is the extension of PIL, which stands for Python Image Library.</br>

# Things you need to do

In the code you can see the code "image = cv.imread("filename.ext")"</br>

Here change the filename and add the image name along with the extension</br>
Make sure that the file is present in the same directory 

That's it you are good to goðŸ˜Š
